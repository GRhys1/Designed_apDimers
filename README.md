# Designed_apDimers

This repository contains a python jupyter notebook session (and outputted files) that can be used to replicate the extraction of data from SOCKET text files downloaded from the CC+ database (http://coiledcoils.chm.bris.ac.uk/ccplus/search/). In the session I calculated frequencies of amino acids found at knobs into hole interactions, which are outputted as csv files and sequence logo plots.
